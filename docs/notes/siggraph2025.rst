Bring your laptop to this hands-on class from basics to the bleeding edge of 3D research,
powered by a dedicated GPU back end for each user and NVIDIA Kaolin Library, a PyTorch-based toolkit for fast,
GPU-optimized operations and interactive applications on Gaussian splats, meshes, and volumetric data.
This lab will focus on new research allowing interactive physics simulation with contact for 3D Gaussians Splats and meshes,
along with an introduction to `NVIDIA Warp <https://developer.nvidia.com/warp-python>`_,
all viewed interactively in Jupyter notebooks hosted on the `NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute <https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/>`_.

This tutorial will be focused on the newly added collision features to simplicits and will also provide an introduction to Warp.
